## Salary Calculator
<br> In Java, you should write a class called "Employee" that represents factory workers and calculates employee salaries with its methods. This class will have 4 attributes and 5 methods.
<br> Attributes of the Class:
+ name : Employee's first and last name
+ salary : The employee's salary
+ workHours : Weekly working hours
+ hireYear : Year of employment

<br> Methods of the Class:

+ Employee(name,salary,workHours,hireYear) : It is a constructor method and will take 4 parameters.
+ tax() : It will calculate the tax applied to the salary.
+ If the employee's salary is less than 1000 TL, no tax will be applied.
+ If the employee's salary is more than 1000 TL, 3% of his salary will be taxed.
+ bonus() : If the employee has worked more than 40 hours a week, bonus wages will be calculated as 30 TL per hour of extra work.
+ raiseSalary() : It will calculate the salary increase based on the employee's start year. Take the current year as 2021.
+ If the employee has been working for less than 10 years, his salary will be increased by 5%.
+ If the employee has worked for more than 9 years and less than 20 years, his salary will be increased by 10%.
+ If the employee has been working for more than 19 years, a 15% raise will be made.
+ toString() : It will print the information of the employee to the screen.

## Finding the Matrix Transpose
<br> Write a program in Java that finds the transpose of a matrix constructed with multidimensional arrays.
<br> To transpose the matrix means to swap the same numbered rows and columns of the matrix. The matrix obtained as a result of this operation is the transpose of the original matrix. At this stage, the transpose (transpose) of a kxn matrix becomes an nxk matrix. For example, suppose we have a matrix A. The transpose of this matrix A is denoted by A^T (A to T).
<br>For example, the transpose of the 2x3 matrix A below is a 2x3 matrix A^T.
